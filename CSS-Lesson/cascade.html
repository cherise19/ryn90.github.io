    <!-- Note that the LI's are blue, even though we did not specify a colour on them 
        It's inheriting the style fom the UL. Similarly, notice how it's overriding the colour to blue from red
        even though we set the body to be red. This is because of CSS Specificty, when there are conflicting styles
        the browser will take the most specific style
